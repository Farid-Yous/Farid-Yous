- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Farid-Yous
I'm a computer science student in UCD Dublin and this is where I will be posting all of my personal projects and other interesting programs.

The 2 starred projects, QrCodeReader and Sentiment Intensity Analyser are 2 summer projects I undertook after completing columbia certified computer vision courses and Stanford certified Machine Learning courses.
